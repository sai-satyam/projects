Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet.Web design is the planning and creation of websites.
This includes a number of separate skills that all fall under the umbrella of web design.Some examples of these skills are information

Two of the most common methods for designing websites that work well both on desktop and mobile are responsive and adaptive design.
In responsive design, content moves dynamically depending on screen size; in adaptive design, the website content is fixed in layout
